1. Java is an object oriented programming language.It is very simple and easy to learn.
    Write once and run anywhere. It is simple, portable, robust.

   JavaC is a java compiler.It is used to compile the java class. Once a java class is compiled it creates a new file as .class file.
   It makes java as a platform independent.

2. JDK- Java Development Kit
        It is used to Write and execute the java file.
        JDK consists of tools and JRE.
   JRE- Java Runtime Environment.
        JRE consists of set of libraries and JVM.
   JVM- Java virtual machine
        It is used to convert java code into byte code. Once we compile the code it creates a new file as .class file
        It makes java as a platform independent. That means we can run the .class file in any operating system. ex- Mac, windows, linux.
        JDK,JRE,JVM is a platform dependent

3. .java file                                               .class file
    .java file is a java file.                        .class file is also a java file
    .java is an file name extension for java           after compilation of .java file JVM creates a new file called as .class file
    it is platform dependent                           it is platform independent.

4. Java IDE's- netbeans, eclipse, andriod studio, notepad++ etc.
   IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment

5.Variable- stores address, pointing to memory,stored in content pool.
  Variables are of 2 types- class name and method name.
  class name consists of 
  method name consists of local variable and parameter
  Variables are declared using the form <type varname>.
  example- int number;
  variables are initialized using the form <type varname = value>
  example- int number=10;
  This type of initializing variables is called as literals.

6. Objected oriented programming in java.
   java is an Objected oriented programming language. It means oject is a real world entities.
   It can be cars, buildings, laptops etc . Which we can see in naked eyes.Object has 2 data members- State(Fields/Variables) and behaviour(methods)
   It has 4 principles- Polymorphism - Same name with different functionalities.
                   Abstraction - Hiding the implementation details and knowing the functionalities.
                   Inheritance - Inheriting the properties from base class to sub class.
                   Encpsulation - Wrapping of same type of code in one place or single unit.

7. It will show error message 'Xworkz', are only accepted if annotation processing is explicitly requested.
  

8. Datatype-
   The type of data stored in a variable is called as datatype.
   types-
   int- it holds the integer values. ex- int num=5;
   float- it holds decimal point values. ex- float num=5.5;
   double- it holds decimal point values. ex- double num=255.234;
   boolean- it gives the values either True or False. Ex- boolean shopOpen=False;
   char- it holdes character values. ex- char location;
   String- it holds alphabets, words as values. ex- String instituename="Xworkz";
   byte- it holds byte values.


9. Dot operator- it is used to access the instance variable values.
   ex- class Laptop{
               String name;
               String brand;

              Laptop(){
                      this.name=name;
                      this.brand=brand;
                      }
             void showinfo(){
                      System.out.println("name=",this.name);
                      
                      System.out.println("brand=",this.brand);
                     }
           }

10. Java features:
    Simple,portable,robust,object oriented,platform independent,

11.array example
   Array is a collection of single type of elements.
   ex-  int arr[]={1,2,3,4,5};

12. Class and Object
    class- Class is a collection of objects.It is a keyword.It is a prototye or blueprint from which object is created.
    it can be written in the form- class Classname{

                                                //statement
                                           }
   object- Object is a instance of a class. Objct is a any real world entities which can be seen through our naked eyes.
   example- Car, Laptop, Airport etc.

13. Keywords-Keywords are nothimg but presserved words.
    class
    if
    else
    for
    switch
    case
    int
    float
    double
    as
    char
    abstract
    boolean
    instance
    ex- for(i=0;i<10;i++)
        {
        
            //code
       }

14. Constructor- it is a special method. Present in class. It should be same name as a class name.
                  Syntax is like a non static method. it has no return type. constructor is used to initialize the instance variables.

     types of constructor- Default constructor, Copy constructor, Parameterized constructor.

15. main method is static because it is a non access specifier.
types of methods- local , parameterized

16.class Program{

int length;
int arr[];
int count=0;

for(i=0;i<count.length;i++)
{
   	
}

}

17. method and method overloading-
    Method is a block of code which runs when it is called.
    method overloading allows a class to have more than one method with the same name but with different parameters.
